## What is this Repository
This repository contains the code portion of my ISM (Independent Study and Mentorship) Original Work. During this project, I explored the various implementations of NLP through technologies such as spaCy, NLTK, and Gensim's API. I also integrated various Machine Learning frameworks such as Naive Bayes and k-nearest-neighbors coupled with deep learning algorithms like convolution neural networks, recurring neural networks, and Transformers such as google BERT.

## What is ISM
ISM (Independent Study and Mentorship) is an enriching elective program available at Frisco ISD high schools for high-achieving juniors and seniors. Students go through a competitive application process to be selected for the program. Once accepted, they engage in year-long research, interviews, and real-world experiences related to their chosen field of study, guided by a mentor. The curriculum includes intensive research, product development, public speaking, interpersonal skills, and more. ISM offers weighted credit, and topics vary annually based on student interests. The application process involves forms, essays, teacher recommendations, and eligibility checks. Successful ISM students are known for their integrity, academic dedication, responsibility, independence, strong work ethic, and maturity.
